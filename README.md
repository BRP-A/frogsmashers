Open source release for Frog Smashers

raithza.itch.io/frogsmashers

A few people have, over time, asked for updates or the source to Frog Smashers. I really like the game as it is, and although there certainly is plenty that could be added or improved, I just don't see myself having the time to work on it anytime soon. I've asked permission from my main collaborator, Mike, and I can finally at least release the Unity project for the game.

I think this is a relatively clean and straightforward project, and might be good for people wanting to learn from it.  Like any piece of software, there are some weird decisions, perhaps specifically with how input is being handled as I've switched away from using InControl to using Unity's new input system, but overall I think things are done in a sane, readable way (much easier when the scope is as small as this game). I'm happy to answer any questions anyone might have on the itch.io forum for the game.

Everyone is welcome to take this and make any kind of spinoff or modded version of the game. License is WIP but hopefully very permissive as long as you don't charge money for anything you make using this without our permission, or try to pass it off as entirely your own work.

If you REALLY like Frog Smashers and might be interested (and capable) of working on it in a more serious fashion, or perhaps interested in publishing, contact me or Mike.
